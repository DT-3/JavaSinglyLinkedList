# JavaSinglyLinkedList
A very rudimentary SLL that just inserts front, for a more complicated version of a SLL go check out my C++ variant. 

This is just a proof that I can in fact still code in Java and create the same data structures that I have been making in C++ (just at a much more basic level becuase again, this is just a proof of concept). All this version contains is a static node class, an insertFront method, and a way to display to proove that it is working even though you really don't need one.
